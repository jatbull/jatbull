# Who am I?

- 👋 Hi, I’m @jatbull, but you can call me James.
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical keyboards (particularly low profile keyboards), video games, music and instruments (I'm a drummer!), and finance/business (I'm an accountant!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python! My only coding experience is an entry course into computer science using javascript, but I'm trying to expand my horizons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my custom-designed low profile, splittable, semi-wireless keyboard called [The Junction]().
